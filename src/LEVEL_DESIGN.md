# Level Design: The First Descent

This document outlines the gameplay mechanics, segment configurations, and performance targets for the initial player experience, covering the first 19+ track segments.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

-   Player can complete Levels 1-2 (segments 0-19+) without manual segment reloading.
-   Waterfall segment (ID 14) triggers a noticeable gravity shift and associated particle VFX.
-   The atmosphere correctly transitions from 'summer' to 'autumn' over a 2-second duration during segment 15.
-   The splash pool / pond segment width is exactly 70 units. This should be verifiable with a debug overlay.
-   The frame rate must remain above 55 FPS during the waterfall drop, even with 400 particles active.
-   There should be no visible terrain "spikes" or seams between segments 13, 14, and 15.
-   **Audio:** Waterfall sound effects should fade in at segment 13, reach their peak at segment 14, and cleanly transition to ambient pond sounds at segment 15.

## 🔗 Dependencies & Blockers

-   **Dependencies:**
    -   Requires the `EnhancedSky` biome blending system (Issue #123).
    -   Requires the `WaterfallParticles` VFX system (Issue #145).
    -   Requires updated `TrackSegment` wall height clamping to prevent visual artifacts (PR #89).
-   **Blocked by:**
    -   Player death/respawn logic for scripted levels is not yet implemented (Issue #156).

## 💻 Segment Technical Specifications

The `getSegmentConfig` function in `TrackManager.jsx` should be updated to use these precise values.

| Segment ID(s) | Phase Description | Type | Biome | Width | Meander | Vertical Bias | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-12** | The Meander | `normal` | `summer` | 35 | 1.2 | -0.5 | Initial gentle river flow. |
| **13** | Approach | `normal` | `summer` | 35 | 0.2 | -1.2 | Steepens, leading to the waterfall. |
| **14** | The Waterfall | `waterfall` | `summer` | 35 | 0.0 | -3.0 | **Particle Count: 400**, `forwardMomentum: 0.15`, **Camera Shake: 0.5**. |
| **15** | Splash Pool | `splash` | `autumn` | 70 | 0.5 | -0.2 | **Transition Duration: 2000ms**, `flowSpeed: 0.3`. |
| **16-18** | The Pond | `pond` | `autumn` | 70 | 0.3 | -0.02 | Wider, calmer area. **Fog: 0.8**, **Tree Density: 0.3**. |
| **19+** | Rapids | `normal` | `autumn` | 35 | 1.5 | -0.7 | More aggressive rapids. **Rock Density: 'high'**. |

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Failure Handling

-   **Player Death during Waterfall:** If the player dies during the waterfall drop (segment 14), they must respawn at the beginning of segment 13 (top of the falls), not at the game's starting point (segment 0).
-   **Missing Splash Pool:** An invisible "catch" collider should be placed at segment 15 to prevent the player from falling through the world if they somehow miss the splash zone.
-   **Low-End Devices:** A particle LOD system should be implemented. If the FPS drops below a certain threshold, the particle count for the waterfall should be reduced from 400 to 100.
-   **Rapid Segment Skipping:** The `onBiomeChange` callback must be debounced to prevent the atmosphere from flickering if a player manages to traverse through segment 15 very quickly.

## 📊 Performance Budget & Benchmarks

-   **Waterfall Segment (14):**
    -   Max Particles: 400
    -   Camera Shake Instances: 1
    -   Additional Draw Calls: 0 (particles should be instanced)
-   **Pond Segment (16-18):**
    -   Tree Draw Distance: Reduced to 50 units (from the default 100) to compensate for the doubled track width.
-   **Target:** Maintain a frame time of `<8ms` on minimum-spec hardware throughout the entire transition from segment 13 to 16.

## 🎨 Required Assets

-   `waterfall_spray.png` (Particle texture, 256x256 with alpha)
-   `ambient_waterfall.ogg` (3D positional audio, loopable)
-   `autumn_fog_gradient.png` (For `EnhancedSky` component)
-   `tree_autumn_red.glb`, `tree_autumn_gold.glb` (Tree model variants)

## 🧪 QA Test Cases

1.  **Slow Drift Test:** Enter the waterfall (segment 14) at minimum speed. The player should land near the center of segment 15.
2.  **Maximum Speed Test:** Enter the waterfall at maximum speed. The player should not overshoot the splash pool area of segment 15.
3.  **Pause/Resume Test:** Pause the game during the atmosphere transition on segment 15 and then resume. The transition should continue smoothly without any color snapping or visual glitches.
4.  **Floating Tree Test:** Carefully inspect the banks of the pond segments (16-18) to ensure that no trees are floating above the terrain or clipping into the water.

## 💎 Future Polish (Defer to separate issue)

-   Implement screen-space water caustics on the splash pool for enhanced visual fidelity.
-   Add a dynamic music crossfade that aligns with the biome transition.
-   Introduce fish jumping VFX in the pond segments to make the environment feel more alive.
-   Add a secret cave entrance along the bank of segment 17.
