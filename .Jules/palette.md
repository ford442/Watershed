## 2024-12-25 - Pointer Lock & Focus Management
**Learning:** In pointer-lock games that support keyboard navigation, global "Enter to Start" shortcuts can conflict with focused UI buttons (like "Restart"). When a specific button is focused, users expect Enter to activate *that* button, not the global action.
**Action:** Always check `document.activeElement` or `event.target` before triggering global shortcuts. If a button is focused, let the native click handler do its job. Also, explicit `role="status"` on game state text (like "GAME PAUSED") is crucial for non-visual users to understand context switches.
