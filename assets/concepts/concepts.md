01_kinetic_flume.png:

First-person POV, hyper-realistic video game screenshot. The player's legs are visible, clad in wet technical gear, sliding feet-first down a narrow, natural rock flume filled with rushing white water. The rock walls are tight, covered in dripping emerald moss. Motion blur on the edges. The water is churning and realistic. 8k resolution, Unreal Engine 5 render.

02_waterfall_dive.png:

Third-person action shot from behind the character. The character is mid-air, diving off a high mossy cliff into a massive, thundering waterfall below. The camera is tilted down, inducing vertigo. The water below is a mix of deep blue and white foam. Mist and spray filling the air. Cinematic lighting, fast shutter speed.

03_raft_journey.png:

Wide angle landscape shot. A turbulent, wide river winding through a majestic mountain valley at sunset. A small, crude wooden raft with a lone figure is navigating the current. The water surface has complex ripples and eddies. Atmospheric fog, photorealistic, epic scale.
