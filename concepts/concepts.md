## Other Concepts

**`02_waterfall_dive.png`**:
Third-person action shot from behind the character. The character is mid-air, diving off a high mossy cliff into a massive, thundering waterfall below. Vertigo inducing.

**`03_raft_journey.png`**:
Wide angle landscape shot. A turbulent, wide river winding through a majestic mountain valley at sunset. Epic scale.

## Image Generation Prompts
(These prompts were used to generate the reference images)

*   **01_kinetic_flume.png:** First-person POV, hyper-realistic video game screenshot. The player's legs are visible, clad in wet technical gear, sliding feet-first down a narrow, natural rock flume filled with rushing white water. The rock walls are tight, covered in dripping emerald moss. Motion blur on the edges. The water is churning and realistic. 8k resolution, Unreal Engine 5 render.
